                <p>Zika is a very dangerous disease and we donâ€™t want it spreading to more people. We made our prototype to try to answer some questions we came up with, how might we provide affordable bug spray that people are not allergic to? Our diffuser concept would answer this question by using our own natural essential oil mixture that keeps mosquitos out for people who are allergic to bug spray. The diffuser will also be small and cheap for lower income communities in warmer climates which are most affected.

                <p>Our product is an a special type of essential oil diffuser. Essential Oil Diffusion is the process of dispersing essential oils so that their aroma fills a room or an area up with the natural fragrance. Our idea is to blend a specific number of oils and you could diffuse it in your house. The model we want to create keeps the mosquitoes away so they don't go inside your home and pssibly infect you. Some of the scents that deter mosquitoes are: citronella, peppermint, lemon, eucalyptus, basil, clove, thyme, lemongrass, geranium, and lavender.</p>
