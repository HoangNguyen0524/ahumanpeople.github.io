                <p>Zika is a very dangerous disease and we donâ€™t want it spreading to more people. The two biggest problems people that have a high chance of getting Zika face is affordability and allergic reactions. We made our prototype to try to solve two problems. <i>How might we provide affordable bug spray?</i>   & <i>How might we make an alternative for people who are allergic to bug spray?</i></p>

                <p>This graph shows the number of cases in weeks from 2015-2016 for the Zika Virus, the Dengue Virus, and the Chikungunya Virus. On this graph, it shows the the different spikes that the diseases had in 2016. As you can see, the Zika Virus had a spike in number of cases from the fourth to the seventh week of 2016.</p>

                <p>Essential Oil diffusion is the process of dispersing essential oils so that their aroma fills a room or an area up with the natural fragrance. We made our prototype to try to answer some questions we came up with, like <i>How might we provide affordable bug spray that people are not allergic to?</i>   Our diffuser concept would answer this question by using our own natural essential oil mixture that keeps mosquitos out for people who are allergic to bug spray. The diffuser will also be small and cheap for lower income communities in warmer climates which are most affected.</p>
