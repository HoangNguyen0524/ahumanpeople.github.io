                <p>I am Carlos Ramirez. I am a 15 year old Mexican-American kid that likes to laugh. I enjoy hanging out with friends and try to be as kind as possible. During this summer I have been attending SMASH Berkeley but during the school year I attend Mission High School. In the near future I hope to attend UC Berkeley and become a mechanical engineer. My goal in life is to be able to provide for my family and eventually buying a house for my mom and dad.</p>

                <p>Hello! I'm Jose Barrios and I attend SMASH Berkeley, the cause of this website's creation. During the school year, I attend Impact Academy of Arts and Technology in Hayward. I have a passion for programming and hope to pursue a career in computer science in the future. I strive to further improve myself for my siblings who look up to me and my mother who depends on my success. I hope to, in the future, open a business that manages websites from the styling to the servers to the data storage.</p>
